**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident**

**Issue Summary:**

During the period from March 10, 2024, 15:30 UTC, to March 10, 2024, 17:45 UTC, our web application encountered a substantial disruption. Users experienced a significant service degradation, with 500 errors peaking at 100% impact. The underlying issue stemmed from an unexpected surge in database connections, triggering a cascading failure within the web server.

**Timeline:**

- **Timezone:** UTC
- **Outage Duration:** March 10, 2024, 15:30 UTC, to March 10, 2024, 17:45 UTC
- **Initiation of Outage:** Identified through automated monitoring alerts at 15:30 UTC.
- **Notification of Staff:** Immediate alert to the relevant teams upon detection.
- **Chronology of Actions:**
  - Examination of web server logs to uncover an elevated number of open database connections.
  - Initial focus on optimizing database queries for a preliminary resolution.
  - Escalation to the database administration team for specialized intervention.
- **Service Restoration:** Full restoration achieved by 17:45 UTC.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the outage was a connection leak in the application code. This flaw resulted in an accumulation of open database connections, subsequently overwhelming the database server and causing a systematic breakdown in the web server's performance.

**Resolution and Recovery:**

Resolution involved an immediate patch to the application code, ensuring the proper closure of database connections after each request. A comprehensive code review was undertaken to identify and address additional potential connection leaks. The resolution process spanned approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

1. **Enhanced Monitoring Protocols:**
   - Strengthening monitoring mechanisms to facilitate early detection of anomalous database connection patterns.

2. **Implementation of Automated Testing:**
   - Integration of automated tests within the CI/CD pipeline to identify and prevent connection leaks during the development phase.

3. **Thorough Codebase Review:**
   - Conducting an exhaustive review of the entire codebase to detect and rectify existing or potential connection leaks.

4. **Documentation Improvement:**
   - Enhancing documentation to provide comprehensive guidelines on best practices for database connection management.

5. **Training Initiative:**
   - Conducting a training session for the development team to heighten awareness regarding potential pitfalls in code leading to similar incidents.

**Lessons Learned:**

The incident underscores the critical importance of swift detection, methodical investigation, and collaborative intervention to minimize downtime and enhance system resilience.
